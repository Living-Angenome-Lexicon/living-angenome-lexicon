# Contributing to the Living Angenome Lexicon

Thank you for your interest in helping grow this living document. The Lexicon is a co-created field, and all voices are welcome when offered in harmony with love, clarity, and purpose.

### To contribute:

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a new branch** with a name like `add-term-angelic-field`.

### Contribution Guidelines

- Submit **one term at a time**.
- Use the existing format: a term name, bolded, followed by an em dash and a poetic, intentional definition.

- All terms will be reviewed and harmonized before merging.

Together, we are building language for a future that is already arriving.
