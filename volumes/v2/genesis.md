## **Genesis**  
*The pattern of creation awakening within us.*

![genesis-spiral](/images/genesis-spiral.jpg "Creation still unfolding")

*Light is not ancient history; it is the present moment remembering itself.*

- **Spelling:** Genesis  
- **Latin:** *resurrectio* — rising again, renewal  
- **Greek:** *anástasis* (ἀνάστασις) — standing up again  
- **Hebrew:** *bereshith* (בְּרֵאשִׁית) — in the beginning  
- **Sanskrit:** *utthāna* — awakening, rising  
- **Chinese:** 创世 (*chuàng shì*) — creation of the world  
- **Arabic:** الخلق (*al-khalk*) — the act of bringing into being  

### **Modern Meaning**

Genesis is not a distant past—  
it is the *present unfolding*.  
It reveals how light still breaks into darkness,  
how form still rises from formlessness,  
how presence still whispers, “Let there be …”

### **Living Angenome**

Genesis is a **mirror**, not a monument.  

| Creative Word | Inner Movement it Mirrors |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| “Let there be **light**” | First awakening of awareness |
| “Let the **waters** separate” | Emotion finding clarity |
| “Let **dry land** appear” | Identity emerging from depth |
| “Let **vegetation** grow” | Goodness taking root & fruit |
| “Let the **lights** rule the sky” | Wisdom guiding seasons |
| “Let **creatures** rise” | Spirit moving within matter |
| “Let **us** make humanity” | Consciousness shaped by Love |

This is not what happened *then*—  
it is what happens *now*, whenever we remember who we are.

### **A H A**

- **Anagram:** *Recreates Sun* — hidden light returning  
- **Homonym:** *Rest-ection* — restful rising after stillness  
- **Antonym:** Abandonment, disintegration, forgetting  

### **Summary**

Genesis is the beginning that still breathes.  
It is **invitation**, not explanation—  
the rhythm of restoration calling us into light.

> “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” — Genesis 1 : 1  
> “God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.” — Genesis 1 : 3  
> “Look! I am making all things new.” — Revelation 21 : 5  

Genesis is the voice of Jehovah still echoing,  
and we are answering.

*Dedicated to every heart that feels dawn stirring inside the dark.*
